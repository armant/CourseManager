Course Manager
=============

CourseManager is a web based application that is built using Python, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS.

This site is entirely student run and managed and every student can create new courses and join an existing course. To keep
things simple there is no concept of semesters or schedules. Courses are universal and anyone who joins a course can see all
the the other people who have ever joined that course.

Specifically, the following user scenarios are enabled:

1. A user can sign up for an account on the site. A user must provide name, email, password and date of birth.
2. A user can log in.
3. Once a user has logged in a user can browse a list of courses available.
4. A user can create a new course, as long as the name doesn't match one of the existing courses.
5. A user can join an existing course as long as they have not already joined it.
6. A user can leave a course as long as they had previously joined it.
7. A user can view the other students who are members of a course as long as they have previously joined the course themselves.
